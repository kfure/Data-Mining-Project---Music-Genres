## Please open Data-Mining-Project---Music-Genres.PDF to view the data mining algorithms and analysis conducted in R.

Predict a song's genre based upon a set of musical attributes and features. I used the FMS (Free Music Archive) Database, which includes 106,574 tracks. I used linear regression, random forest, K-means clustering, predictive analysis with Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.
